Coding Notes:

* add a refresh button at the top

* use icons for buttons

* change level coloring to color by count ranking

* add top area stats and functions

* add a way to mark a song just in this UI

* post it on GitHub, Reddit, or something

* find a way to detect/debug a bad song

* clean-up code
