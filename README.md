BeatSaberMan is an open source Beat Saber custom song manager written by [Carmen DiMichele](https://dimichelec.wixsite.com/carmendimichele) 

This C# Windows WPF app makes it easy to review the list of custom songs you currently have installed
  on Beat Saber, see play stats, fix a song that has bad beatmaps that won't load, and delete a song folder and its contents.


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------

Coding Notes:

* only reload song that's been fixed after fixing a song

* add top area stats and functions:
  - count of songs, count of maps with errors, etc.
  - button to fix all erroneous maps
  - sort/filter buttons by artist, filter level(s), filter errors...

* add high score info

* select practice mode or something to signal a delete in BSM

* is there a way to setup a filter in BSM that will show-up in BS, or
  re-order list to show up in BS in a differnt order

* change level coloring to color by count ranking

* make an icon

* add a way to mark a song just in this UI

* post it on GitHub, Reddit, or something

* clean-up code
